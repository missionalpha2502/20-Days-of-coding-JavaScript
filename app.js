//OBJECTIVE:
//In this challenge, we review some basic concepts that will get you started with this series.
//You will need to use the same (or similar) syntax to read input and write output in challenges throughout HackerRank.

//TASK:
//To complete this challenge, you must save a line of input from stdin to a variable, print Hello, World. on a single line,
//and finally print the value of your variable on a second line.


//SOLUTION:- 

function processData(inputString) {
    // This line of code prints the first line of output
    console.log("Hello, World.");

    // Write the second line of output that prints the contents of 'inputString' here.
    console.log(inputString);
}
